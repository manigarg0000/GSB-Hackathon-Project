# gsb-hackathon-project
this project is for the girls of south bay hackathon


This is a simple app which helps you store the words that you come across daily and don't know their meaning. I have used MVVM architecture and Room Persistence 
library to store the data and Intent to show the meaning of the word on clicking it using browser.
This app also help you delete the words which are no longer needed by swiping them left or right.
